AI-Powered Health Assistant 
Access to basic medical information is crucial, but many individuals struggle to get timely advice. While online resources exist, they may be unreliable or difficult to interpret. This project addresses the need for an AI-powered health assistant that provides reliable, accessible, and user-friendly health-related guidance.

This project presents an AI-Powered Health Assistant, designed to assist users in addressing health-related queries, providing general medical information, and suggesting potential next steps based on symptoms. The assistant integrates NLP techniques, pre-trained transformer models, and rule-based logic to enhance user interaction.
The objectives of this project are to develop an AI chatbot that can:
•	Understand and process health-related queries effectively.
•	Provide informative and relevant responses based on predefined logic and AI-based text generation.
•	Offer recommendations for seeking medical advice where necessary.
The methodology involves using Streamlit for the frontend, Hugging Face's DistilGPT-2 for text generation, and NLTK for text preprocessing. The chatbot is implemented with basic rule-based logic for common health concerns and leverages machine learning for open-ended queries.
Results indicate that the chatbot can effectively engage with users, offering accurate and relevant responses. Future enhancements include improving medical accuracy using a fine-tuned medical AI model and integrating appointment scheduling features.
